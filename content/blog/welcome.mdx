## A gym built for people, not algorithms

After 20 years coaching in big-box gyms and boutique studios across the Atlanta metro, we knew something was missing. Most gyms are designed to sell memberships, not to actually coach people.

## Why Lilburn?

Lilburn and the surrounding Gwinnett County communities — Stone Mountain, Tucker, Norcross, Snellville — have incredible people who deserve better than a crowded class where nobody learns their name. We chose this neighborhood because it feels like home.

## What makes us different

Every class at Seen Fitness is capped. Strength & conditioning maxes out at 12. Kickboxing at 16. Somatic movement at 8. These aren't arbitrary numbers — they're the point at which a coach can no longer give you individual attention.

## Come see for yourself
