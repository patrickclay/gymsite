# Landing Page Content Design

## Approach

Hybrid of "The Mirror" (identity-based empathy) and "The Story" (founder narrative). The visitor is the protagonist; the founders earn credibility through brief, human moments rather than full bios.

## Target Audience

- Gym-frustrated adults who tried big-box gyms, felt unseen, and gave up
- Fitness beginners intimidated by gym culture who need a welcoming entry point

Both groups share a core need: believing it can be different this time.

## Core Emotion

Transformation and hope. Every section answers: "What does this mean for me?"

## Positioning

A fitness program built with you, not just for you. You're known by name, not membership number. Community-first, small group intimacy.

## Urgency Strategy

Subtle warmth. No countdown timers or scarcity language. Urgency comes naturally from "we're building this now, come be part of it."

## Terminology

Use "fitness program" or "fitness class" instead of "gym" throughout. "Gym" carries the baggage we're differentiating from.

## Page Sections

### 1. Hero

**Psychology:** Empathy hook + future-self visualization

- Headline: A short, identity-level statement that mirrors what the visitor wants to feel. Direction: "You've been looking for a fitness program that actually sees you."
- Subhead: Bridge to founders. One sentence that says "we built this because we felt the same way." Weaves in 20+ years credibly but keeps focus on the visitor.
- CTA: Email signup above the fold. Button text shifts from "Stay in the Loop" to something emotionally resonant, e.g. "Be part of it from day one."
- Schedule preference ask remains. It IS the community-first proof.

### 2. "We Get It" Bridge (NEW section)

**Psychology:** Empathy mapping (labeling) + narrative transportation

This section does not exist on the current page. It sits between hero and class offerings.

- 2-3 short lines naming the visitor's past frustrations without being heavy-handed:
  - Overcrowded classes where no one learns your name
  - Cookie-cutter programs that don't meet you where you are
  - Feeling like you need to already be fit to walk through the door
- Founders' pivot: 1-2 sentences, the emotional turning point. Direction: "We spent 20 years coaching in spaces that weren't built for the people who needed them most. So we're building one that is."
- Tone: Warm, direct, conversational. Not a sales page.

**Why it matters:** Naming specific frustrations activates the labeling principle. When someone accurately describes your problem, you automatically trust them with the solution.

### 3. Class Offerings

**Psychology:** Identity anchoring + outcome visualization

Shift from what the class IS to who you BECOME.

- Section intro: A short framing line. Direction: "Three ways in. All of them yours."
- Each card contains:
  - Short, evocative name (keep existing names)
  - One line about the FEELING, not the format
  - One concrete detail signaling intimacy/quality (class size, coach-to-member ratio, coaches learn your name)

Card directions:

**Strength & conditioning:**
- Emphasize progression and being coached, not just supervised
- Transformation: "from unsure to confident under the bar"

**Kickboxing & self-defense:**
- Emphasize empowerment and release
- Transformation: "walk in carrying your day, walk out carrying yourself differently"

**Somatic movement:**
- Emphasize the mind-body connection as the studio's unusual differentiator
- Transformation: "the class no one expects to love and can't stop talking about"

### 4. Bottom CTA (The Invitation)

**Psychology:** Co-creation effect (IKEA effect) + commitment consistency

- Heading: Tie co-creation to transformation. Direction: "This isn't built yet. That's the point."
- Body: 1-2 sentences making signup feel like joining, not subscribing. Their input shapes the schedule, the classes, the culture.
- Button text: Shifts to match invitation tone, e.g. "I'm in" or "Count me in"
- No-pressure line: "No spam. Just updates as we build this together."

**Why it matters:** People value things more when they helped create them. The micro-commitment of email signup primes the larger commitment of membership.

### 5. Footer

**Psychology:** Grounding + subtle social proof

- Location: Keep "Atlanta area - Coming soon." Add neighborhood hint if available for specificity.
- Social links: Keep Instagram and Facebook placeholders.
- One quiet human line about the founders. Direction: "Founded by two coaches who'd rather know your name than count your reps."

## Design Decisions

- No scarcity or countdown language. Warmth over pressure.
- "Fitness program/class" terminology, never "gym."
- Visitor is protagonist throughout. Founders appear in supporting role.
- Every section earns the next scroll. Hero stops the scroll, Bridge builds trust, Cards show the path, CTA converts with invitation.
