# Update the product spec when shipping features

When you implement or change **product-facing features** (user-visible behavior, new pages, new flows, or changes to existing ones):

1. **Update the product spec:** [docs/gym_website_prd.md](docs/gym_website_prd.md)
   - Add or revise the relevant section under "Feature Requirements" (or elsewhere as appropriate).
   - Describe what was built and how it works in enough detail for future readers and for SEO/positioning.

2. **Bump the revision history** at the bottom of `docs/gym_website_prd.md`:
   - Add a new line: `- **vX.Y** - Short description of the change (Month Year)`

This keeps the PRD the single source of truth and makes it easier for the team (and AI) to understand what the product does and what is implemented.
